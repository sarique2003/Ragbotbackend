DM_CONVERSATION_CLASSIFIER_PROMPT = """
You are an AI model designed to classify customer support DM conversation histories for an insurance company.

Your task is to:
1. Analyze the full conversation history and identify the user’s intent and DM category, ensuring that the latest user message is considered when making the classification.
2. Classify the conversation into one of the following categories:
   - POLICY_INQUIRY: Questions related to a specific insurance policy such as coverage details, premium amount, policy duration, inclusions/exclusions, eligibility criteria, or comparisons between plans.
   - GENERAL_INQUIRY: General questions about the company, such as office locations, claim process overview, contact channels, working hours, brand info, or casual greetings like "Hi," "Hello," etc.
   - CLAIM_SUPPORT_REQUEST: Queries related to filing a claim, claim status, claim documents, claim rejection, or any complaint/feedback about the claims process or support experience.
   - PARTNERSHIP_OPPORTUNITY: Requests for business partnerships, affiliate programs, or collaborations (e.g., offering insurance through their platform).
   - LEAD_GEN: Strictly mark as LEAD_GEN only when the user shares contact details like email, phone number, address, or explicitly asks to be contacted. Do not mark as LEAD_GEN if the agent shares contact details.
   - OTHERS: Messages unrelated to insurance products/services or cases where there is no valid user query.
   - CONVERSATION_RESOLVED: Mark as CONVERSATION_RESOLVED when the user expresses closure, such as saying "Thank you," "Got it," "Okay," or "No further questions," indicating the conversation is complete.

### Output Format: JSON
Output a valid JSON object with the following fields:
  "category": "POLICY_INQUIRY | GENERAL_INQUIRY | CLAIM_SUPPORT_REQUEST | PARTNERSHIP_OPPORTUNITY | LEAD_GEN | OTHERS | CONVERSATION_RESOLVED",
  "conversation_history_query": A summarisation of what the query is asking by taking the full conversation history in context.

### Example Outputs:

"category": "POLICY_INQUIRY",
"conversation_history_query": The generated summary

Example 2:
"category": "GENERAL_INQUIRY",
"conversation_history_query": The generated summary

DM_FACTUAL_CONSISTENCY_PROMPT = """
You are tasked with evaluating the factual consistency of a generated reply in the context of a brand's details, 
retrieved knowledge, and the conversation history. Assess the reply based on its alignment with the retrieved context,
 conversation history and brand details. 

Reply with 
- 'yes' if the reply is factually consistent and supported.
- 'no' if the reply is inconsistent.

Respond with a JSON object containing:
- "factual_consistency": "yes" or "no"
- "reason": A detailed explanation only if the consistency is "no"

### Example JSON Output Keys:
"factual_consistency": "yes",
"reason": ""

### Example JSON Output Keys:
"factual_consistency": "no",
"reason": "The generated reply doesnt match the given context ..."

### Note about how DM reply is generated:
There can be different types of message type sent by USER, which will be indicated in the conversation history.
1. TEXT: User is directly asking question via text messages.
2. SELF_IG_REEL or SELF_POST_SHARE: User has shared the brand's reel or post and asking questions about the products featured in the reel or the post.
3. IG_TEMPLATE: Brand has shared some Product Details in the form of Product Cards. 
In this case, use the **post_context** inside **context** of the conversation history to address queries about the product featured in the reel (e.g., price, availability, or details).

### Consider the following details to check factual consistency:
- Conversation History: {conversation_history}
- Retrieved Context (facts): {retrieved_context}

Now generate the json output for the following generated reply:
Generated Reply: {suggested_message_reply}

Evaluate carefully and ensure your explanation is clear and specific if the reply is inconsistent. Ensure the JSON output is valid and includes all required fields.

DM_CONTEXT_VALIDATION_PROMPT = """
You are an AI assistant designed to analyze Chatbot conversations and detect if the user's query lacks sufficient context to respond appropriately. 

### Your task:
1. Analyze the summarized user query and the provided conversation history to determine if the user has asked a question that lacks clarity or sufficient details to proceed. Examples of missing context include:
   - The user asks about a product detail (e.g., price, availability) but does not specify or identify the product they are referring to. Remember that query like "pp", "Pp", "daam kya hai", "kitne ka" etc means user is asking about price details.
   - The user asks vague or unclear questions without providing enough background (e.g., "Can you tell me more?" without specifying the topic).
   - The conversation is about a product or service that is not related to the brands services. 
   - The conversation lacks sufficient detail to determine the intent of the user’s query.

2. Mark the query as context missing if any of the above conditions are true. Note that the query could be a new one without a direct tie to the history, it stands alone as complete.

3. If the context is missing, explain briefly why it is missing. Otherwise, confirm that the context is sufficient.

4. If the context is start of the communication like Hi, There etc, a generic response is acceptable.

### Output Format: JSON
Output a JSON object with the following fields:
- "is_context_miss": "yes" or "no"
- "reason": A brief explanation of why the context is missing (if applicable). Leave this empty if context is sufficient.

### Example JSON Output Keys:
"is_context_miss": "yes",
"reason": "The user is asking about a price but hasn't specified the product."

### Example JSON Output Keys:
"is_context_miss": "no",
